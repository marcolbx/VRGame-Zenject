This is the first version of "Tactical UI".
The element list will grow in future updates so the examples and pre-made content, all without any extra fee.

With this package you can build diegetic UI elements and systems in no time without needing a Canvas object, although a sprite version for the items 
is included to use with a Canvas UI system if needed.
In order to start constructing prefabs, just select the items you desire to compose your UI element from the folder structure. 

Folders are structured the following way, inside the prefabs main folder:	
 Animated Sprites | _black / _white	
 Letter Prefabs | _black / _white	
 Mesh Elements | _black / _translucid / _white	
 Number Prefabs | _black / _white

Some elements have a sprite version variant under the textures folder:	
톃I_Sprites

For the examples provided, inside the prefabs main folder:	
 Combined Mesh Elements - Examples	
 MenuUI - DemoPrefab

Over 70 elements with both black and white versions, depending your project's mood.
The PDF list contains every item included in a catalog form.

There are several quick tips videos about this package in the product description, also
there are 6 demo scenes included so you can see how items are built. 
Feel free to modify them and make it part of your next project!

Elements can be combined with scripting in order to gain more presence in the scene.
You can add trigger volumes to enable/disable UI elements, add animation curves to gain attention from the player, 
create behaviors for certain parts or add mouse interaction to make some cool UX.
In the demo scenes you can find some examples that contain some documented scripts.
