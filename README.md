# VRGame-Zenject. FPS Invasion VR
 
Welcome to my sample code project. 

The whole game was made by me using some assets which I have obtained from the Unity Asset Store.
Since it is a VR game some conditions were taken into account while developing like texture resolution, mesh quality, optimized particle systems and many more. 

This project was created with the MVC pattern in mind and using the injection dependency framework Zenject.
